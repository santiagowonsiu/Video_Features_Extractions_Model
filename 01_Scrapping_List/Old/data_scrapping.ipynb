      "Content: Like the other films in the series, the theme of family (and bonds of friendship) is present underneath the over-the-top action. Characters are encouraged to form better relationships with loved ones, and the main characters both have a strong sense of duty and devotion to their superiors -- even though they blow everything up and face no consequences, they're trying to do the right thing. Anxiety is treated lightly/dismissively.\n",

      "Content: The main characters are likable, but they're also unapologetically violent and crude and never face any consequences. Even their family-like bond now seems stretched thin. One character struggles with the misconception that he's \"cursed\" and brings violence down upon his loved ones; he begins to suffer panic attacks, which isn't taken/discussed seriously and is solved with a simple slap on the face and someone saying saying \"it's not your fault.\" Another character has a near-death experience and realizes that he has \"nothing to fear,\" which dissolves into a series of jokes about how he tests this theory.\n",

      "Content: The two lead characters and many others are Black; co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are Belgian filmmakers of Moroccon descent. Black performers/athletes Tiffany Haddish, John Salley, and DJ Khaled appear in small roles. Police captain Rita Secada is played by Paola Núñez, who was born in Mexico. Jacob Scipio, who plays Mike's son, Armando, has Indo-Guyanese and English ancestry. Vanessa Hudgens, who co-stars as Kelly, is of Filipina descent. These are all heroic roles; most of the villainous roles are played by White men. In one scene, Mike and Marcus are forced to steal clothes from two White Miami residents, and there's some dialogue suggesting that they may be White supremacists, but this isn't condoned in any way. A White man in a prison scene has a Swastika tattoo. Key female characters are tough, but they're also largely bystanders/supporters of the male characters; some women are objectified. A form of torture in which fingernails are removed is referred to as a \"Colombian manicure.\"\n",

Rape is implied when a White man pulls an African woman's legs toward him, and she starts to cry even harder. Dehumanization/cruelty montages portray how Dalit men are forced to work in excrement as they unclog public bathroom facilities. Reenactment of Trayvon Martin's murder.

He's played by Jackson Kelly, who's open with his own struggles with this diagnosis. It's rare to see a male character in mainstream media with anorexia or bulimia, and conversations between the counselors revolve around how to interact with someone with this diagnosis without creating a bigger issue.

Incidents are too numerous to list in full but they include about the worst things people could do to each other: beatings, rape, shootings, mass murders, killing of women and children, and torture. A Polish commando unit interrupts enemy troops as they put civilian men, women, and children against a wall to be shot. We see a man's fingernails torn out. A man bloodied from beatings and starving is forced to stand for hours with his hands above his head. There are reports of vile and painful medical experiments perpetrated on Auschwitz prisoners under Nazi orders, including the opening of the bellies of pregnant women without anesthetic. A Polish officer slugs Pilecki, who tries to follow his Christian conscience, and he offers his face again, explaining that he has \"turned the other cheek,\" as Christ recommended. One dying prisoner worries the Germans will eat him after he dies, claiming he saw a mutilated body that the liver had been eaten out of. An opportunistic hungry prisoner takes the bread from the pocket of a starved, dying prisoner, claiming to someone watching that it's okay because the man \"is dead already.\" Women and children are shot, beaten, raped, and otherwise treated brutally. Heads are seen as bloody pulps. Corpses lie in pools of blood. People dig their own graves before falling into them. Naked prisoners are beaten. Prisoners are forced to work in the cold without warm clothes. Starved prisoners are forced to walk distances carrying heavy loads of bricks.\n",

Sen. Smith, Maggie, and Alaine are portrayed as the heroes of the film because they speak for the immigrants, defending them against further mistreatment, but their open-mindedness feels a bit historically inaccurate, given that in the early 1900s, racism and racial violence were still upheld by the federal government. Maggie and Alaine are free-thinking, independent women—but that depiction might also feel somewhat inaccurate, since women faced significant sexism in the working environment at that time, and marriage was still seen as a much more viable option for women. But none of these aspects of the early 1900s are discussed in the film.\n",

The documentary uses archival footage and photographs and expert interviews to explain the political and social pressures that led to the formation of this segregated unit, including the influence of civil rights activists who pushed for legislative changes to the Selective Service Act of 1940. Additionally, the series highlights the Double V campaign initiated by the NAACP and the Black press, advocating for victory against fascism abroad and racial injustice at home. The series is a rich resource for learning about resilience, innovation, and the fight for equality.\n",
