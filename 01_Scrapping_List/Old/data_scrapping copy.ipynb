      "Label: Positive Messages\n",
      "Content: Like the other films in the series, the theme of family (and bonds of friendship) is present underneath the over-the-top action. Characters are encouraged to form better relationships with loved ones, and the main characters both have a strong sense of duty and devotion to their superiors -- even though they blow everything up and face no consequences, they're trying to do the right thing. Anxiety is treated lightly/dismissively.\n",

      "Label: Positive Role Models\n",
      "Content: The main characters are likable, but they're also unapologetically violent and crude and never face any consequences. Even their family-like bond now seems stretched thin. One character struggles with the misconception that he's \"cursed\" and brings violence down upon his loved ones; he begins to suffer panic attacks, which isn't taken/discussed seriously and is solved with a simple slap on the face and someone saying saying \"it's not your fault.\" Another character has a near-death experience and realizes that he has \"nothing to fear,\" which dissolves into a series of jokes about how he tests this theory.\n",

      "Review 3:\n",
      "Label: Diverse Representations\n",
      "Content: The two lead characters and many others are Black; co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are Belgian filmmakers of Moroccon descent. Black performers/athletes Tiffany Haddish, John Salley, and DJ Khaled appear in small roles. Police captain Rita Secada is played by Paola Núñez, who was born in Mexico. Jacob Scipio, who plays Mike's son, Armando, has Indo-Guyanese and English ancestry. Vanessa Hudgens, who co-stars as Kelly, is of Filipina descent. These are all heroic roles; most of the villainous roles are played by White men. In one scene, Mike and Marcus are forced to steal clothes from two White Miami residents, and there's some dialogue suggesting that they may be White supremacists, but this isn't condoned in any way. A White man in a prison scene has a Swastika tattoo. Key female characters are tough, but they're also largely bystanders/supporters of the male characters; some women are objectified. A form of torture in which fingernails are removed is referred to as a \"Colombian manicure.\"\n",

Helicopter crash. Explosions. Bombs dropped via drone. Grenade. Fighting, punching, kicking, slapping. Character collapses from a heart attack. A man shoots a woman in the face, off-camera, to make it look like she died by suicide. Description of \"Colombian manicure,\" in which a character's fingernails are forcibly removed with pliers; brief flash of character screaming in pain.
